## Execution Instructions

This notebook requires 17GB of memory. It will not run on a Standard TF JaaS instance (15GB). You will need to select an instance with memory > 17GB.

Some of the cells in the notebook display images. The images will not appear until the cell for copying the training data/misc from GCS into the JaaS instance is executed.
